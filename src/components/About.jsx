            Before eating anything expired, check for signs of mold, odd
            coloring, and smells. This app is used as a guideline, but there is
            always the risk of faulty food packaging and poor preparation.

            This app is used to track foods in storage. Food can be consumed
            post-sell-by and expiration date as long as it doesnâ€™t show signs of
            going bad.
